## Description:
This is retail therapy for the persnickety pups of the world! This project started after I made a large donation of dog toys and clothes to my local Goodwill. I had always looked to other dog parents for ideas as to what my Miniature Schnauzer Davinci might enjoy...and it never quite worked out. Davinci is what I affectionately call a diva dog and the items on this e-commerce site are a few of his favorite things!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Project Wins & Challenges
* Created my first solo full stack application
* Worked with Redux slices, reducers, constants, and actions
* Spent additional time in React and strengthened my understanding of concepts

* Redux concepts were challenging and there is room for improvement in this area
* Created the actions but understanding how it all needed to connect was grueling at times
* Watched several tutorials on Stripe checkout to get things up and running
